# Traffic-Sign-Detection
In this project, we investigated machine learning and deep learning models for
 traffic sign detection (TSD) to enhance road safety. We
 explored various techniques on the GTSRB dataset.
 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), especially
 VGG16, in which we achieved the highest accuracy of
 96.9% due to its ability to learn features directly from
 images. Analysis of precision, recall, and F1 scores
 revealed trade-offs between different models. VGG16 is a
 promising choice for TSD, with further exploration
 possible for other models.
